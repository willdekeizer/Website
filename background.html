                <p> I was born in New Jersey. In my childhood, my family moved to Spain and England for my Dad's career. I think Spain was my favorite because of their food and beautiful
                    terrain. We use to go rock climbing there. Because we moved around a lot, I do not necessarily have a "home town", but Spain is probably where I get homesick the most.
                    The school we went to was an international school, so instead of learning full on Spanish, I became fluent in "Spanglish". Meaning, people would start a sentence in Spanish
                    and finish in English, or vice versa. I grew to love 'futbol' or Soccer and played a lot of it at our lunch hour and after school hours. My favorite food is probably a meat dish
                    called "chulet√≥n". It a type of cut you can not really get here in America. <br><br>

                    In England, while not my favorite place, is were I developed my independence as a teenager. Public transportation is insanely well built, you could easily meet up with friends anywhere
                    without your parents driving you or you needing a license. There were bus stops or train stops in every neighborhood. Food courts and shops were always a few blocks away from each other.
                    I also learned certain behaviors in public especially in public transportation, the tube line, queing, the appropriate times to talk to a stranger. It is often rare for someone to greet
                    you and say "hello" on the street! In fact, from what I remember the most common phrase I have heard was "excuse me" or "sorry". If you are on the tube or train, people will not 
                    talk to each other unless there is an external factor causing delays, then you complain amongst yourselves. And then of course, the nights after futbol games, especially the long 
                    lived rival of Arsenal and Liverpool, attendees will go back in the tube, often drunk, chanting and singing and encouraging others in the tube line to join them. The pub is also 
                    the most common place to interact with strangers and that is generally how you meet people who live in your neighborhood. <br> <br>

                    We moved back to the states for my senior year of high school so that I can get a U.S. Diploma. Throughout all this time I was heavily into computers, gaming, music, chess, and 
                    rubik's cubes. I've spent many hours in the early days of the internet configuring local LANs for LAN parties, modding games for compatability and other mod hacks. I have also spent
                    many years learning music production, software, and sound design. <br><br>
                    
                    And now, after a few years inthe I.T. industry, I have returned to University to finsh a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science. I am thankful that I can do their online asynchronous program
                    so that I can continue to work. I am currently learning front end development and langauges like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The next languages on the list are ReactJS, NodeJS, and Python. <br><br>
                    
                    This is just a little bit of my history and how its transformed into the person I am today! Feel free to contact me in email or at linkedin!
